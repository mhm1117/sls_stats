# StS Stats Website
My Slay the Spire stats collected, put together, and displayed all nice and useful like


## To-Do List

- [x] 1. Search function for neow's bonus box
- [x] 2. Show dialog box w/ neow's bonus win rates by cost when hover/click bonus in list
  - [x] a. Dialog box of by cost table doesn't show up when search used - poss solution: save cost table
           htmls in list and access them by the rows that are in the list when resetting the rows post search
- [x] 3. Add filter for runs w/ prismatic shard added in beginning
- [x] 4. Style the run history of main page
- [x] 5. Clean up style.css doc
  - [x] a. Nest rules (if can) as much as poss to make more readable/collapsable
  - [x] b. Rename html classes + IDs for more consistency + **(clean up redudancy in rules - ??? I think this is good, CHECK AGAIN)**
- [ ] 6. Make runs in run history clickable to bring up large dialog box of relic, card, etc. info. - need to gather info in Python first
- [ ] 7. Improve Documentation of js file
  - [ ] Add method headers to new + future functions
  - [ ] Add single line comments throughout code for future Mattie <3
- [ ] 8. Make it so clicking on a character img in overall info takes you to that character's page (maybe make no tabs and make everything sort of on this one page/more interactable)

## Possible Fun Features/Designs
- [ ] 1. Make Overall Info + Neow Tables more minimalist and clean
  - [x] No table for overall info, just name of character on top and     percent and/or ratio of wins/games below (maybe hover over percent to see dialog of wins/games, maybe diff colors for char names)
  - [ ] No titles? ~~overall info~~, run history, neow, 
  - [x] Bigger rows for neow
  - [ ] Maybe change neow bonus + cost tables to be more interesting/colorful - in style of how neow bonus buttons look in game? - **DESIGN IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] 2. Add sort by/filter feature for run history
  - [ ] sort by (date, asc lvl)
  - [ ] filter (victory, character, asc lvl, heart), maybe have filter affect displayed win rates/neows on right? - **IN PROGRESS - NEXT: ADD FORM FUNCTIONALITY, MAKE CHECKBOXES ACTUALLY FILTER, MAYBE WHEN MOUSING OUT OF DROPDOWN OR ADD "APPLY" BUTTON**
- [ ] 3. Add cool transition effect for tabs in navbar
