# [StS Stats Website](https://mhm1117.github.io/sts-stats/)
My Slay the Spire stats collected, cleaned, and nicely displayed.


## To-Do List

**TOP TO-DO: HAVE RUNS FOLDER IN PROJECT W/ RUNS FROM PC + LAPTOP - NOT FOR USE BUT TO MAKE SURE BOTH ARE UP-TO DATE**

- [x] 1. Search function for neow's bonus box
- [x] 2. Show dialog box w/ neow's bonus win rates by cost when hover/click bonus in list
  - [x] a. Dialog box of by cost table doesn't show up when search used - poss solution: save cost table
           htmls in list and access them by the rows that are in the list when resetting the rows post search
- [x] 3. Add filter for runs w/ prismatic shard added in beginning
- [x] 4. Style the run history of main page
- [x] 5. Clean up style.css doc
  - [x] a. Nest rules (if can) as much as poss to make more readable/collapsable
  - [x] b. Rename html classes + IDs for more consistency **(+ clean up redudancy in rules - ??? I think this is good, CHECK AGAIN)**
- [ ] 6. Make runs in run history clickable to bring up large dialog box of relic, card, etc. info. - need to gather info in Python first
- [ ] 7. Improve Documentation of js file **- IN PROGRESS**
  - [ ] Add method headers to new + future functions **- IN PROGRESS**
  - [ ] Add single line comments throughout code for future Mattie <3 **- IN PROGRESS**
- [x] 8. Make it so clicking on a character img in overall info takes you to that character's page (got rid of tabs for now)
  - [ ] Or maybe make it just open dialog box and you can expand if you want to? not sure what would look cooler/be more functional
- [ ] 9. Add some kind of "click for more info" when hovering over character

## Possible Fun Features/Designs
- [ ] 1. Have some display of all wins / games ratio? Maybe in one of top corners? Or in run history section that gets changed when filtering?
- [ ] 2. Make Overall Info + Neow Tables more minimalist and clean
  - [x] No table for overall info, just name of character on top and percent and/or ratio of wins/games below (maybe hover over percent to see dialog of wins/games, maybe diff colors for char names)
  - [x] No titles? ~~overall info~~, run history, neow, 
  - [x] Bigger rows for neow
  - [ ] Maybe change neow bonus + cost tables to be more interesting/colorful - in style of how neow bonus buttons look in game? **- POSS DESIGN IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] 3. Add sort by/filter feature for run history
  - [ ] sort by (date, asc lvl)
  - [x] filter (victory, character, heart)
  - [ ] maybe have filter affect displayed win rates/neows on right?
- [ ] 4. Add tutorial to explain how to use site + what things mean
- [ ] 5. Add settings section? idk what for yet but to toggle / change some things? 
- [ ] 6. **PROB CANCELLED** Add cool transition effect for tabs in navbar
